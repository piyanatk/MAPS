MAPS - The MIT Array Performance Simulator
==========================================

MAPS is a collection of programs to simulate the operation of a radio 
interferometer. Please see the manual in doc/manual.html for details.

Requirements:
------------
MPICH/MPICH2: Required for visgen. The MPICH installation needs to install the
	compiler script "mpicc" so that visgen can be compiled.
CFITSIO: Required for maps2uvfits, MAPS_im2uv, MAPS_makesky.
FFTW3:  Required for MAPS_im2uv.
NETCDF: Required for generate_ionoscreen
F77 compiler. (Newer fortran compilers are probably OK, but you might need 
               to tweak a makefile.)
wcslib v4.2 or better. (http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/)

Typically CFITSIO installs its header files in the non-standard 
          location /usr/include/cfitsio/.
The Makefiles have this location included by default. If the cfitsio
headers go elsewhere, the makefile "-I/usr/include/cfitsio" directives
will need to be changed.
Likewise, FFTW3 requires header files (fftw3.h etc) and 
      libraries (libfftw3.so etc).
If these are installed in non-standard locations, then the makefiles will need
updated with "-I/location_of_headers -L/location_of_libraries"

Installing:
----------

1- setup
- Unpack MAPS. A base directory "MAPS" will be created with a number 
    of files and directories in it.
- setup scripts: The MAPS base directory contains two files "sim_setup.csh" 
    and "sim_setup.sh". These scripts must be "sourced" by your shell 
    before MAPS will compile and run. The line that sets the environment 
    variable "SIM" *must* be changed to be the base maps installtion.
- source the setup script. Either "source sim_setup.csh" for csh/tcsh 
    or ". sim_setup.sh" for sh/bash like shells.
- optionally you can put a command to source the setup scripts in your 
    dot files.

2- compile

There is a top-level Makefile. Type "make" at the top level MAPS directory to
make everything. You can also "make clean" to clean object files and
libraries. You can build/clean in individual directories too, but start with the
"utilities" directory if you do.


Configuration/Data files:
------------------------
array/:
This directory contains defintions of interferometer array station locations. A
"station" can consist of one or more individual receivers that are phased
together.


test/:
This directory contains test configurations and example output files.

stn_layout/:
This directory contains files which specify the location of receivers within a
single station.
