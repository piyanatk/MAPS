This document details how to generate turbulent ionospheres.  All settings for the generated ionosphere can
be changed by editing write_netcdf.c.  The inner and outer scales of turbulence are set in the #define area
at the beginning of the code.  Where the output is written to is set at the end of the variable declaration
section in the main function.  Which height profile is loaded is set in the call to generate_iono_turbulent.
The height profiles are from the International Reference Ionosphere where HeightProfile1 is solar max during
summer, HeightProfile2 is solar max during winter, HeightProfile3 is solar min during summer, HeightProfile4
is solar min during winter, HeightProfile5 is solar med during summer, and HeightProfile6 is solar med during 
winter.  Finally, the size, location, and granularity of the array can be adjusted by changing the values for
the variables in the function define_iono_grid.  Once these changes have been made, everything should be 
recompiled using the makefile.  A new ionosphere can then be generated by executing write_netcdf.
