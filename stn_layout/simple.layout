* This is an example of a file specifying the layout of antennas comprising a
* station.  Antenna locations are specified in a 3-D rectangular coordinate
* system (north, east, height).  The origin of the coordinate system is the
* station location, and the (north, east) plane is tangent to the earth's
* surface at that point.  The height coordinate is positive away from the center
* of the earth.  All dimensions are in meters.  The intention is to have a
* limited number of station layout files, which are repeatedly referenced in any
* given array specification (i.e. multiple stations use the same layout).
