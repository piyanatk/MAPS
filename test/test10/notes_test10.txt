Test 10
=======

Purpose: Basic test of all-sky 500-tile (like) system with unpolarised phased array
dipole-over-groundplane antennas in the stations where the stations are phased away from the zenith.
Actually, it is making the phased array antennas point to a different position than the input phase center.
This is done with the "PNT_center_RA" and "PNT_center_Dec" args in the obs_spec file. Note the decimal hours
and degrees not the hour-minute-second format.

No ionosphere.
This sim uses a pre-canned list of point sources.

In this sim we "trick" LOsim and visgen into doing all-sky sims even though the input FOV is listed as
412530 arcsec. Note that 412530 is exactly 2 radian. Since the input sky is sine projected, the pixel angular size
is only correct at the center of the image. Specifying FOV of 2 radian effectively makes the input image 2pi radian,
hence all-sky.

To run:
0: don't forget to source sim_setup.csh (or .sh)

1: run LOsim
LOsim test10 > /dev/null
s
x

2: run im2uv
MAPS_im2uv -i test10_Brightness.fts -o test10_Visibility.dat -n 4

3: run visgen
; for LOsim etc.
visgen -n test10 -s MWA_ED -A $SIM/array/mwa_random_500_dipole_gp.txt -G test10_Visibility.dat -V obs_spec_test10 -N -m 1 > visgen.out
; for OOB
visgen -n test10 -s MWA_ED -A $SIM/array/mwa_random_500_dipole_gp.txt -Z -V obs_spec_test10 -N -m 1 -O oob_list.txt > visgen.out

4: run maps2uvfits
maps2uvfits test10.vis test10.uvfits -26.4311 117.357 400.0 $SIM/array/mwa_random_500_dipole_gp.txt

5: image the snapshot:
example in miriad, but you can use whatever you want.
miriad
rm -rf test10.uv
fits in='test10.uvfits' out='test10.uv' op='uvin'
rm -rf test10.beam test10.map
invert vis=test10.uv beam=test10.beam map=test10.map imsize=2048,2048 cell=201.43
convert to an image:
fits in='test10.map' out='test10.fits' op='xyout'


For pointing centre RA: 0.5, DEC: -41.6 (with ra=0 at meridian)
alt,az of pointing centre = 73.623540,200.25443 degs
results for LOsim sources:
after imaging, point sources should have the following total fluxes. Use miriad task 'uvfit' to get total flux
from a slightly resolved gaussian:
uvfit vis=test10.uv object=gaussian spar=1.,0.,0.,10.,10.,0
total flux = 0.3273
uvfit vis=test10.uv object=gaussian spar=1.,54000.,0.,10.,10.,0
total flux = 0.2572
uvfit vis=test10.uv object=gaussian spar=1.,0.,-54000.,10.,10.,0
total flux = 0.9662


results for OOB sources:
uvfit vis=test10.uv object=point spar=1.,0.,0.
total flux = 0.335. expect 0.332
uvfit vis=test10.uv object=point spar=1.,-53400,0.0
flux = 0.389, expect: 0.386
uvfit vis=test10.uv object=point spar=1.,0,-54000.0
flux=1.013, expect: 1.008
