Test 03
=======

Purpose: Basic test of wide field MWA 32 (like) system with phased array
stations having dual pol receptors. Does not do ionospheric stuff at all.
This is for basic polarised response.

To run:
1: run LOsim
LOsim test03 > losim.out
s
x

2: run im2uv
MAPS_im2uv -i test03_Brightness.fts -o test03_Visibility.dat -n 0.274156

3: run visgen
visgen -n test03 -s MWA_ED -A $SIM/array/mwa_32_simple_crossdipole.txt -G test03_Visibility.dat -V obs_spec_test03 -N -m 0 > visgen.out

4: run maps2uvfits
maps2uvfits test03.vis test03.uvfits -26.4311 117.357 400.0 $SIM/array/mwa_32_simple_crossdipole.txt

5: image the snapshot:
example in miriad, but you can use whatever you want.
miriad
rm -rf test03.uv test03.beam test03.clean test03.map test03.restor
fits in='test03.uvfits' out='test03.uv' op='uvin'
rm -rf test03.beam test03.map
invert vis=test03.uv beam=test03.beam map=test03.map imsize=512,512 cellsize=60
optionally clean and restore:
clean map=test03.map beam=test03.beam out=test03.clean niters=1000
restor model=test03.clean beam=test03.beam map=test03.map out=test03.restor

Expected result:
After LOsim: file "test03_Brightness.fts" will be created. This should be 512x512 pixels with 3 point(ish) sources in it. Viewing this file in DS9 or some FITS WCS aware viewer should have the sources at:
RA 0      , DEC -26:32.   value, 4.96e6
RA 23:53:38 DEC -29:01:49 value, 1.33e7
RA 00:07:17 DEC -24:09:10 value, 7.67e6
Note that East will be to the right in this image.

After MAPS_im2uv:
There should be a file "test03_Visibility.dat" with size 4194312 bytes.

After visgen:
There should be a file "test03.vis" (size 135096 bytes) and "test03.stn" (13312 bytes).

After maps2uvfits:
There should be a file "test03.uvfits", size 48960 bytes.

After imaging:
The 3 sources should be in the dirty beam at loctions above.
source fluxes should be:
1.0Jy/beam (centre)
1.71      RA 00:07:17 DEC -24:09:10
2.68	   RA 23:53:38 DEC -29:01:49
the reduced fluxes are because the array uses phased array tiles which reduce power away from the zenith.
